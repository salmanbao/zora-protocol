# Contract and Token Metadata

Contract metadata has the following json schema:

```json twoslash
{
  "name": "{contract name}",
  "description": "{contract description}",
  "image": "{contract image}"
}
```

Token metadata has the following json schema:

```json twoslash
{
  "name": "{token name}",
  "description": "{token description}",
  "image": "{token image ipfs url}",
  "animation_url": "{token media ipfs url}",
  "content": {
    "mime": "{content mime type}",
    "uri": "{content ipfs uri}"
  },
  "attributes": {
    "trait_type": "{trait type}",
    "value": "{trait value}"
  }
}
```

Note that the `image` field should be a mime type starting with `image/`, however, for best rendering support use `png`, `jpg`, or `gif` images. Be aware larger file sizes may have issues rendering but also can display artifacts. It is recommended to test your images first on [testnet](https://testnet.zora.co/) networks and verify the thumbnails and media work.

The `content` field supports _any_ mime type as the base of the NFT and is optional but for strong rendering support please ensure the `animation_url` field is set with an valid mime type (valid file types are: `gltf, glb, webm, mp3, mp4, m4v, ogv, and ogg along with mp3, wav, oga, and .html`).

Contract and token metadata should be pinned to IPFS using a preferred pinning service,
and the url when set on a contract or token should be in an ipfs url format, like: `ipfs://{cid}`.

More information about pinning and pinning services can be found at [ipfs documentation](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/work-with-pinning-services/#use-a-third-party-pinning-service).

Refer to the SDK guide to [contract](/protocol-sdk/metadata/contract-metadata) and [token metadata](/protocol-sdk/metadata/token-metadata) for utilities and sample code to build and pin the json metadata to IPFS.
