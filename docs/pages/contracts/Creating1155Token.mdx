# Creating a Token

Calling `setupNewTokenWithCreateReferral` on a deployed 1155 contract will create a new token.
In addition, by passing in your address as the `createReferral` will yield you rewards from those mints. 
All tokens start at tokenId 1 and increment up. 
tokenId 0 is reserved for the contract information.
`maxSupply` should be set to `MAX_INT` for an open edition.

```solidity
function setupNewTokenWithCreateReferral(
    string calldata newURI,
    uint256 maxSupply,
    address createReferral
) public onlyAdminOrRole(CONTRACT_BASE_ID, PERMISSION_BIT_MINTER) nonReentrant returns (uint256)
```

## Token Metadata

Each token in a Zora 1155 or 721 contract has a metadata uri field which points to a JSON Metadata file, pinned to [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/), 
containing the media associated with the token as well as additional descriptive info. [Refer to the SDK guide on building token metadata](/protocol-sdk/metadata/token-metadata) 
for schematic info, utilities, and sample code to build and pin the json and corresponding assets to IPFS.


## Updating Metadata
`updateTokenURI` updates the token URI for a token. 
Won't work for tokenId 0 since that is reserved for the contract level information.

```solidity
function updateTokenURI(
    uint256 tokenId, 
    string memory _newURI
)
```

Updates the contract metadata.
```
function updateContractMetadata(
    string memory _newURI, 
    string memory _newName
)
```
