# Comments

The Comments contract allows for comments to be made on any Zora 1155 token. Only 1155 token owners or holders can comment on that token. 
If the commenter is an owner, they must pay a Spark to comment. If the commenter is a creator, they can comment for free.  

Comments can be Sparked by anyone, meaning that the Sparker must send a Spark as a form of liking a comment.  

## Contracts

The protocol consists of a single upgradeable contract called `Comments`, that is deployed deterministically to the same address on all chains. There is also a helper contract called `CallerAndCommenter` that enables minting and commenting in a single transaction.

| Contract | Deterministic Address |
| ----- | ------- |
| Comments | [0x7777777C2B3132e03a65721a41745C07170a5877](https://explorer.zora.energy/address/0x7777777C2B3132e03a65721a41745C07170a5877) |
| CallerAndCommenter | [0x77777775C5074b74540d9cC63Dd840A8c692B4B5](https://explorer.zora.energy/address/0x77777775C5074b74540d9cC63Dd840A8c692B4B5) |

## Spark value distribution

When a commenter pays a Spark to comment on a token, the Spark value (less a protocol fee) is sent to the token's creator reward recipient.
When a commenter pays a Spark to reply to a comment, the Spark value (less a protocol fee) is sent to the original commenter as a reward.
When a Spark is used to Spark a comment, the Spark value (less a protocol fee) is sent to the commenter.

For each Spark value transaction, a 30% protocol fee is taken. If a referrer is specified, 20% goes to the referrer and 10% goes to Zora. Otherwise, 30% goes to Zora. A referrer can be a third-party developer that surfaces the ability to comment on a site or app,
and the referrer address is specified as an argument when commenting or Sparking.

## Building on comments and earning referral rewards

Developers can integrate the Comments contract into on their platform from day one and earn referral rewards when users when users spark a comment on their platform. 

When a referral address is specified when minting or sparking, 20% of the total Spark value is paid out to the referrer.

To earn referral rewards, developers should [specify a referrer address in the function calls](#specifying-a-referrer)

## What is a Spark?

[A Spark is a fundamental concept in the Zora ecosystem.](https://support.zora.co/en/articles/1829633)
It serves as a unit of value and can be used to pay for mints and other interactions:

- Sparks are [1155 tokens on the Zora network.](https://explorer.zora.energy/address/0x7777777b3eA6C126942BB14dD5C3C11D365C385D) They can be purchased with credit/debit cards or ETH, primarily used to cover minting fees for NFTs on Zora.
- **Each Spark has an immutable value of 0.000001 ETH**
- In the context of the Comments contract, Sparks are used to pay for comments (for non-creators) and to "like" or endorse comments made by others.
- Sparks can be unwrapped by their owner, allowing the underlying ETH value to be used for other transactions.

## Backfilled legacy comments

Before the Comments contract's deployment, comments were made on other contracts that emitted `MintComment` events. To enable users to reply to or Spark these older comments, we backfill the new Comments contract with legacy comment data. This process:

1. Saves onchain unique IDs for the legacy comments.
2. Allows users to interact with pre-existing comments since they have an onchain ID.

## Usage

### Commenting 

Commenting can be done by calling the `comment` function, paying with the equivalent value in Sparks:
```solidity
interface IComments {
  struct CommentIdentifier {
      address commenter;
      address contractAddress;
      uint256 tokenId;
      bytes32 nonce;
  }

  /// @notice Creates a new comment. Equivalent Sparks value in ETH must be sent with the transaction. Must be a holder or creator of the referenced 1155 token.
  /// If not the owner, must send at least 1 Spark. Sparks are transferred from the commenter to the Sparks recipient (either the creator when there is no replyTo, or the replyTo commenter).
  /// @param contractAddress The address of the contract
  /// @param tokenId The token ID
  /// @param commenter The address of the commenter
  /// @param text The text content of the comment
  /// @param replyTo The identifier of the comment being replied to (if any)
  /// @return commentIdentifier The identifier of the created comment, including the nonce
  function comment(
    address commenter,
    address contractAddress,
    uint256 tokenId,
    string calldata text,
    CommentIdentifier calldata replyTo,
    address referrer
  ) external payable returns (CommentIdentifier memory commentIdentifier) {
  }
}
```

Example usage with `@zoralabs/protocol-deployments` and `viem`:

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
// @filename: config.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/contracts/comments/config.ts]

// @filename: example.ts
// ---cut---
// [!include ~/snippets/contracts/comments/comment.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/contracts/comments/config.ts]
```

:::

Note: The `getSparksValue` function is used to calculate the equivalent ETH value for a given number of sparks. It's implementation is not shown here but is crucial for determining the correct payment amount.

### Replying to a comment

When a comment is created, it is associated with a unique identifier. This identifier is used to reply to the comment.
The unique identifier contains an autoincrementing nonce generated by the contract that is used to ensure that the identifier is unique
for a given commenter, contract, and tokenId. 

When replying to a comment, the replyTo argument is the identifier of the comment being replied to.

```solidity
interface IComments {
  struct CommentIdentifier {
      address commenter;
      address contractAddress;
      uint256 tokenId;
      bytes32 nonce;
  }

  function comment(
    address commenter,
    address contractAddress,
    uint256 tokenId,
    string calldata text,
    // this identifies the comment that we are replying to 
    CommentIdentifier calldata replyTo, // [!code focus]
    address referrer
  ) external payable returns (CommentIdentifier memory commentIdentifier) {
  }
}
```

Example usage with `@zoralabs/protocol-deployments` and `viem`:

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
// @filename: config.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/contracts/comments/config.ts]

// @filename: comment.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/contracts/comments/comment.ts]

// @filename: example.ts
// ---cut---
// [!include ~/snippets/contracts/comments/reply.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [comment.ts]
// @filename: config.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/contracts/comments/config.ts]

// ---cut---
// [!include ~/snippets/contracts/comments/comment.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/contracts/comments/config.ts]
```
:::

### Sparking a comment

Sparking a comment is done by calling the `sparkComment` function, paying with the equivalent value in Sparks.
Sparking a comment is similar to liking a comment, except it is liked with the value of Sparks attached. The Spark value gets sent to the commenter, with a fee taken out.

```solidity
interface IComments {
  struct CommentIdentifier {
      address commenter;
      address contractAddress;
      uint256 tokenId;
      // nonce is a unique value that is generated when a comment is created. It is used to ensure that the comment identifier is unique
      // for a given commenter, contract, and tokenId.
      bytes32 nonce;
  }

  /// @notice Sparks a comment. Equivalent Sparks value in ETH to sparksQuantity must be sent with the transaction. Sparking a comment is
  /// similar to liking it, except it is liked with the value of Sparks attached. The Spark value gets sent to the commenter, with a fee taken out.
  /// @param commentIdentifier The identifier of the comment to Spark
  /// @param sparksQuantity The quantity of Sparks to send
  /// @param referrer The referrer of the comment
  function sparkComment(CommentIdentifier calldata commentIdentifier, uint64 sparksQuantity, address referrer) public payable;
}
```

Example usage with `@zoralabs/protocol-deployments` and `viem`:

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
// @filename: config.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/contracts/comments/config.ts]

// @filename: example.ts
// ---cut---

```

```

### Minting and commenting

When minting with the `ZoraTimedSaleStrategy`, which is the default way to mint on Zora,
a comment can be included at no additional cost by calling the function `timedSaleMintAndComment()` on the `CallerAndCommenter` helper contract. While the comment itself is free, the standard mint fee still needs to be sent with the transaction.

```solidity
// Deployed to 0x77777775C5074b74540d9cC63Dd840A8c692B4B5 on all chains supported by Zora.
interface ICallerAndCommenter {
    /// @notice Mints tokens and adds a comment, without needing to pay a spark for the comment.
    /// @dev The payable amount should be the total mint fee. No spark value should be sent.
    /// @param commenter The address of the commenter
    /// @param quantity The number of tokens to mint
    /// @param collection The address of the 1155 collection to mint from
    /// @param tokenId The 1155 token Id to mint
    /// @param mintReferral The address to receive mint referral rewards, if any
    /// @param comment The comment to be added. If empty, no comment will be added.
    /// @return The identifier of the newly created comment
    function timedSaleMintAndComment(
        address commenter,
        uint256 quantity,
        address collection,
        uint256 tokenId,
        address mintReferral,
        string calldata comment
    ) external payable returns (IComments.CommentIdentifier memory);
}
```

Example usage with `@zoralabs/protocol-deployments` and `viem`:

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
// @filename: config.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/contracts/comments/config.ts]

// @filename: example.ts
// ---cut---
// [!include ~/snippets/contracts/comments/mintAndComment.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/contracts/comments/config.ts]
```
::: 

### Specifying a Referrer

When calling the `comment`, `sparkComment`, or related functions, a referrer address can be specified. This allows third-party developers to earn a portion of the protocol fee when users interact with the Comments contract through on their platform.

To specify a referrer, simply include the referrer's address as the last argument in the function call:

:::code-group
```ts twoslash [example.ts]
// @filename: config.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/contracts/comments/config.ts]

// @filename: example.ts
// ---cut---
// [!include ~/snippets/contracts/comments/referrer.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/contracts/comments/config.ts]
```
:::

### Commenting as a smart wallet owner

An account that is a smart wallet owner can comment on a token, if a smart wallet 
is an owner or creator of the token.  In this case, the smart wallet address should
be passed as the `smartWallet` argument when calling the `comment` function.   The function
will check if the smart wallet or the account that is creating the comment is an owner or creator of the token,
but will attribute the comment to the account that is calling the comment function.  Correspondingly,
the `commenter` argument must match the account that is creating the comment.

Example usage with `@zoralabs/protocol-deployments` and `viem`:

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
// @filename: config.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/contracts/comments/config.ts]

// @filename: example.ts
// ---cut---
// [!include ~/snippets/contracts/comments/commentWithSmartWallet.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/contracts/comments/config.ts]
```

### Cross-Chain commenting, sparking, and minting with comments

An account can sign a permit to comment, spark a comment, or mint and comment on their behalf, and that permit can be used to execute the action onchain. 
This enables cross-chain functionality for these actions by validating that the signer of the message is the original commenter, sparker, or minter. Here's how it works:

1. When creating the permit, the user specifies two chain IDs:
   - `sourceChainId`: The chain ID where the permit is being signed.
   - `destinationChainId`: The chain ID where the permit should be executed.

2. To enable cross-chain functionality:
   - Set `sourceChainId` to the current chain where you're signing the permit.
   - Set `destinationChainId` to the chain ID of the target blockchain where you want the action to be executed.

3. The permit can then be signed on a source chain and submitted to the appropriate contract on the destination chain, allowing the action to be executed there.

For example, if you're signing a permit on Base, but want the action to occur on Zora Network, you would set:
- `sourceChainId` to 8453
- `destinationChainId` to 7777777

This process works for:
- Commenting (using the `Comments` contract)
- Sparking a comment (using the `Comments` contract)
- Minting and commenting (using the `CallerAndCommenter` helper contract)

1. Example cross-chain commenting with Relay:

## Events

The `Comments` contract emits the following events:

```solidity
interface IComments {
    /// @notice Event emitted when a comment is created
    event Commented(
        bytes32 indexed commentId, // Unique ID for the comment, generated from a hash of the commentIdentifier
        CommentIdentifier commentIdentifier, // Identifier for the comment, containing details about the comment
        bytes32 replyToId, // Unique ID of the comment being replied to (if any)
        CommentIdentifier replyTo, // Identifier of the comment being replied to (if any)
        uint256 sparksQuantity, // Number of sparks associated with this comment
        string text, // The actual text content of the comment
        uint256 timestamp, // Timestamp when the comment was created
        address referrer // Address of the referrer who referred the commenter, if any
    );

    // Event emitted when a comment is backfilled
    event BackfilledComment(
        bytes32 indexed commentId, // Unique identifier for the backfilled comment
        CommentIdentifier commentIdentifier, // Identifier for the comment
        string text, // The actual text content of the backfilled comment
        uint256 timestamp, // Timestamp when the original comment was created
        bytes32 originalTransactionId // Transaction ID of the original comment (before backfilling)
    );

    // Event emitted when a comment is Sparked
    event SparkedComment(
        bytes32 indexed commentId, // Unique identifier of the comment being sparked
        CommentIdentifier commentIdentifier, // Struct containing details about the comment and commenter
        uint256 sparksQuantity, // Number of sparks added to the comment
        address sparker, // Address of the user who sparked the comment
        uint256 timestamp, // Timestamp when the spark action occurred
        address referrer // Address of the referrer who referred the sparker, if any
    );
}
```

When minting and commenting, the `MintedAndCommented` event is emitted from the caller and commenter contract, containing
more contextual information about the mint and comment, as well as a link to the comment via the comment identifier. When buying or selling on secondary and commenting, the `SwappedOnSecondaryAndCommented` event is emitted, containing the same contextual information as the minted and commented event, as well as the quantity of tokens bought or sold.

```solidity
interface ICallerAndCommenter {
    /// @notice Emitted when tokens are minted and a comment is added
    /// @param commentId The unique identifier of the comment
    /// @param commentIdentifier The struct containing details about the comment
    /// @param quantity The number of tokens minted
    /// @param text The content of the comment
    event MintedAndCommented(
        bytes32 indexed commentId, 
        IComments.CommentIdentifier commentIdentifier, 
        uint256 quantity, 
        string text
    );

    /// @notice Emitted when tokens are bought or sold on the secondary market and a comment is added
    /// @param commentId The unique identifier of the comment
    /// @param commentIdentifier The struct containing details about the comment
    /// @param quantity The number of tokens bought
    /// @param comment The content of the comment
    /// @param swapDirection The direction of the swap (BUY or SELL)
    event SwappedOnSecondaryAndCommented(
        bytes32 indexed commentId,
        IComments.CommentIdentifier commentIdentifier,
        uint256 indexed quantity,
        string comment,
        SwapDirection indexed swapDirection
    );
}
```
