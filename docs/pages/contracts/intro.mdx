# Introduction

##### Creator contracts make it easy to deploy and sell an NFT collection

These contracts allow anyone to deploy [ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) NFT collections in seconds.
In addition, these contracts **provide built-in sales mechanics**, making it easy to both deploy a collection and sell the initial mints.
