# ERC-721 NFT Creator

> ⚠︎ 721 NFTs can ***only*** be created and managed on the contract and API level but not on the zora.co UI level.


This contract is in charge of deploying new NFT contracts. 
The factory references an `implementation` contract and clones it to give it it's own unique address.

View the contract code [here](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-drops-contracts/blob/main/src/ZoraNFTCreatorV1.sol) and the list of deployed addresses [here](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-721-contracts/tree/main/addresses).

## Edition vs Drop 
This contract can be used to create either `Editions` or `Drops`.

- `Editions`: All the NFTs share the same media asset.
- `Drops`: All the NFTs have individual pieces of media.

Platforms have the ability to earn some of the protocol rewards for helping creators deploy their smart contracts.

## Global Variables

- `implementation`: An NFT contract used for cloning.
- `editionMetadataRenderer`: A contract for rendering editions metadata.
- `dropMetadataRenderer`: A contract for rendering drops.
