# Creating a contract

All 1155 contracts created from Zora are deployed by calling a central factory contract.
When calling this factory it will deploy a minimal proxy contract that is upgradeable.
All upgrades are opt-in and must be done manually on a per contract basis by the user.

- [Factory Contract Code](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-protocol/blob/main/packages/1155-contracts/src/factory/ZoraCreator1155FactoryImpl.sol)
- [Deployed Addresses](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-protocol/tree/main/packages/1155-deployments/addresses)
- Factory Proxy Address `0x777777C338d93e2C7adf08D102d45CA7CC4Ed021` on all networks

**The easiest way to create Zora 1155 contracts using the factory is [by using the sdk.](/protocol-sdk/creator/onchain)**

## Calling the Factory Contract
The `createContract` function on the factory is responsible for deploying a new 1155 contract. 
The `setupActions` parameter allows for multiple actions to be called when deploying the contract.
Such as creating a token and sale in the same transaction as deploying the contract.

- `contractURI`: The URI for the contract metadata
- `name`: The name of the contract
- `defaultRoyaltyConfiguration`: The default royalty configuration for the contract
- `defaultAdmin`: The default admin for the contract
- `setupActions`: The actions to perform on the new contract upon initialization (optional)
```
function createContract(
    string calldata newContractURI,
    string calldata name,
    ICreatorRoyaltiesControl.RoyaltyConfiguration memory defaultRoyaltyConfiguration,
    address payable defaultAdmin,
    bytes[] calldata setupActions
) external returns (address)
```

:::note
The contract supports multicall so multiple functions can be called to set up the contract in a single transaction.

To configure a Splits contract as the recipient address, [follow this guide.](/protocol-sdk/creator/splits)

## Contract URI 
The Contract URI contains contract specific details. This metadata is stored in a JSON file on IPFS. 
The uri is retrieved via the `contractURI()` call on the contract.

Refer to the [SDK guide on building contract metadata](/protocol-sdk/metadata/contract-metadata) for schematic info and some sample code.

## Setup Actions
An optional param that is encoded function data that can be passed in and can call a separate function within the contract.
This allows creating a token and setting permissions in the same transaction of creating the contract. Actions that can be called:
- Creating a token
- Setting the salesConfig
- Granting permissions/minter role
- Admin minting tokens
