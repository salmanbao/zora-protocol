# Protocol Rewards

## Introduction

At Zora, we are passionate about providing the best experience to create and earn onchain.
**Protocol Rewards** is a split of the Zora mint fee allowing:

- Creators to monetize their work
- Developers to earn from NFT mints and creations they facilitate

## Fee Split (Per Mint)

#### Free Mint

| Create Referral | 0.0000111 ETH |

| Zora            | 0.0000111 ETH |
| Market          | 0.0000111 ETH |

#### ERC20 Mint

| Recipient       | Amount       |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| Creator | 95% of earnings from sales |
| Mint Fee | 5% of listed purchase price|
| Create Referral | 28.57% of Mint Fee |
| Mint Referral   | 28.57% of Mint Fee |

**Mint Referral**: The platform that referred a specific mint of an NFT  

**Create Referral**: The platform that referred the creator to deploy the NFT collection. The creator is determined by the royaltyRecipient of the token followed by the funds recipient of the contract.

**First Minter**: Only for premints, this is the first collector to execute the premint. In a non-premint context, this reward is paid out to the creator of the NFT. *Note: For ERC20 Mints, the creator is set as the First Minter and earns First Minter rewards by default.*


## How It Works: Creator

1. Creator selects the **"Free + Rewards"** pricing option when creating their 721 or 1155 NFT
2. Creator specifies a wallet address eligible to claim their rewards
3. Creator opens up their edition for minting -- **that's it!**

The creator's total ETH generated from rewards is aggregated into an [escrow contract](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-protocol/blob/main/packages/protocol-rewards/src/ProtocolRewards.sol) and can be withdrawn at any time.

## How It Works: Developer

### Create Referral Reward

The create referral reward is paid out to the developer or platform that referred the creator to deploy their NFT collection using Zora's contracts.

#### Creating an ERC-1155 Token with Rewards

The `createReferral` address is specified upon token creation.

```
function setupNewTokenWithCreateReferral(
    string calldata newURI,
    uint256 maxSupply,
    address createReferral
) public
```

### Mint Referral Reward

The mint referral reward is paid out to the party that referred the collector to mint an NFT.

#### ERC-1155 Minting with Rewards

```
function mintWithRewards(
    IMinter1155 minter,
    uint256 tokenId,
    uint256 quantity,
    bytes calldata minterArguments,
    address mintReferral
)
```

## Withdrawing Rewards

Rewards must be withdrawn from the escrow contract, which the address can be found [in the readme](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-protocol/tree/main/packages/protocol-rewards).

```solidity
function withdraw(address to, uint256 amount) external;
```

Withdraw for another address directly.

```solidity
function withdrawFor(address to, uint256 amount) external;
```

```solidity
function withdrawWithSig(
    address from, 
    address to,
    uint256 amount, 
    uint256 deadline, 
    uint8 v, 
    bytes32 r, 
    bytes32 s
)
```
