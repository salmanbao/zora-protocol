# Building Contract Metadata

Zora 1155 and 721 contracts have contract-wide json metadata containing descriptive info
about the contract, including a name and image.  This json metadata is pinned to [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/).


The structure of Contract Metadata is defined in a type exported from the SDK, ContractMetadataJson:

```ts
type ContractMetadataJson = {
  name?: string;
  description?: string;
  image?: string;
} 
```

The `image` field should point to an image file pinned to ipfs.

The Zora Protocol SDK exports a type `ContractMetadataJson` that defines this json structure.

Here's some example code for building contract metadata json:

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
// @filename: pinata.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/ipfs/pinata.ts]

// @filename: example.ts
// ---cut---
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/ipfs/contractpinata.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [pinata.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/ipfs/pinata.ts]
```
