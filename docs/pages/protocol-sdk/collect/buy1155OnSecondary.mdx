# `buy1155OnSecondary`

The `buy1155OnSecondary` function on the `collectorClient` allows you to purchase ERC1155 tokens on the secondary market. This function prepares a transaction with slippage protection for buying a specified quantity of 1155 tokens using ETH.

## Important Limitations

Before using this function, ensure that the following conditions are met:

1. The ERC1155 token must be configured to use the ZoraTimedSaleStrategy.
2. The primary mint period for the token must have ended.
3. The secondary market for the token must have been launched.
4. There must be sufficient liquidity in the pool for the swap.
5. The buyer must have enough ETH to cover the purchase price, including any slippage.

If any of these conditions are not met, the function will return an error and the transaction cannot be executed. Always check the `error` field in the returned object before proceeding with the transaction.

```

## Returns

`{ error?: string, parameters?: SimulateContractParameters, price: QuotePrice }`

### error

- **Type:** `string | undefined`

An error message if the operation cannot be completed. This could be due to reasons such as insufficient balance, market not being active, or other contract-specific issues.

### parameters

- **Type:** `SimulateContractParameters | undefined`

Prepared parameters for simulating/writing a transaction using viem/wagmi. This will be undefined if there's an error.

### price

- **Type:** `QuotePrice`

Detailed information about the price breakdown for the purchase. This includes:

- **wei:** Price breakdown in wei
  - **perToken:** Price per individual token in wei
  - **total:** Total price for all tokens in wei
- **sparks:** Price breakdown in sparks
  - **perToken:** Price per individual token in sparks
  - **total:** Total price for all tokens in sparks

## Parameters

### contract

- **Type:** `Address`

The address of the ERC1155 contract to buy an 1155 of.

### tokenId

- **Type:** `bigint`

The ID of the ERC1155 token to buy.

### quantity

- **Type:** `bigint`

The quantity of 1155 tokens to buy.

### account

Additional ETH will be sent to account for slippage, and any excess ETH will be refunded at the end of the transaction.

The address that will receive the purchased 1155 tokens. If not specified, the tokens will be sent to the `account` address.
