# `sell1155OnSecondary`

The `sell1155OnSecondary` function on the `collectorClient` allows you to sell Zora ERC1155 tokens for ETH on the secondary market. This function prepares a transaction with slippage protection for selling a specified quantity of tokens for ETH.

## Important Limitations

Before using this function, ensure that the following conditions are met:

1. The ERC1155 token must be configured to use the ZoraTimedSaleStrategy.
2. The primary mint period for the token must have ended.
3. The secondary market for the token must have been launched.
4. There must be sufficient liquidity in the pool for the swap.
5. The seller must own the tokens they are attempting to sell.

If any of these conditions are not met, the function will return an error and the transaction cannot be executed. Always check the `error` field in the returned object before proceeding with the transaction.

## Usage

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/collect/sell1155OnSecondary.ts]
```


## Returns

`{ error?: string, parameters?: SimulateContractParameters, price: QuotePrice }`

### error

- **Type:** `string | undefined`

An error message if the operation cannot be completed. This could be due to reasons such as insufficient token balance, market not being active, or other contract-specific issues.

### parameters

Prepared parameters for simulating/writing a transaction using viem/wagmi. This will be undefined if there's an error.

### price

- **Type:** `QuotePrice`

Detailed information about the price breakdown for the sale. This includes:

- **wei:** Price breakdown in wei
  - **perToken:** Price per individual token in wei
  - **total:** Total price for all tokens in wei
- **sparks:** Price breakdown in sparks
  - **perToken:** Price per individual token in sparks
