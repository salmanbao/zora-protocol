# withdrawRewards

Protocol Rewards and [onchain Secondary Royalties](https://support.zora.co/en/articles/2519873) can be withdrawn in a single transaction by executing the parameters generated from calling `withdrawRewards` on the `creatorClient`. The `withdrawRewards` function prepares a multicall transaction that withdraws both the rewards and royalties balances for each ERC20 token associated with the specified account.

When using the Protocol SDK, any account can execute the transaction to withdraw rewards on behalf of another account. However, the rewards and royalties will always be sent to the original balance holder. This feature allows for scenarios such as a bot withdrawing rewards and covering the gas costs on behalf of the creator.

The `withdrawFor` parameter specifies the account for which to withdraw the rewards. The `account` parameter is set to the account that will execute the transaction.

By default, both Protocol Rewards and Secondary Royalties are withdrawn. If you wish to exclude Secondary Royalties from the withdrawal, set the `claimSecondaryRoyalties` parameter to `false`.
