# getRewardsBalances

The `getRewardsBalances` function on the `creatorClient` allows you to view the rewards and royalties balances for any account. This function returns two types of balances:

1. Protocol Rewards: The total rewards balance from primary sales, stored in the Protocol Rewards contract.
2. Royalties: The total royalties earned from [onchain secondary sales.]() The royalties balances are aggregated by ERC20 token and also include the sum for ETH. This provides a comprehensive view of an account's earnings from both primary and secondary sales.
