# Ethereum vs Zora Network


Zora Network harnesses the Bedrock release of the [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), which is purposely structured to mimic Ethereum as closely as possible. 
Still, there exist slight differences in the behavior of the Zora Network compared to Ethereum. 


When building applications on the Zora Network, these nuances should be noted:
- New blocks are created every 2 seconds on the Zora Network.
- The gas limit for a Zora Network block is 30,000,000.
