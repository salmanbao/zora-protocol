# Connecting MetaMask

### Adding to MetaMask
Addresses in your MetaMask will work and be the same on both Ethereum and the Zora Network.
However, to submit transactions to the Zora Network you must add the network to your wallet. 

- First, open the MetaMask desktop extension
- Click on where it says **Ethereum Mainnet** at the top and click **Add Network**

- Lastly, add in the configuration details listed in the network section [here](./network). Once saved, you will then be able to submit transactions on the Zora Network.
