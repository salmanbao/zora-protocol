# Bridging

## Bridging User Interfaces

The official bridge for a native bridge can be found at https://bridge.zora.energy/.

To bridge ERC-20s, the optimism superbridge.app supports ZORA: https://superbridge.app/zora.

For instant bridging, multiple providers allow for instant bridging both from and to the ZORA network.

## Bridging Technical Details

### ETH => Zora Network

ETH can be bridged from Ethereum (L1) to the Zora Network (L2) by calling `depositTransaction` on the L1 contract address below. 
It will take about **1-2 minutes** for funds to show up on the Zora Network. 
You must also set the gas limit to **60,000**.
The ETH must also be set as the `value` in the overrides of the transaction.

```
depositTransaction(
    address _to, // Target address on L2.
    uint256 _value, // ETH value to send to the recipient.
    uint64 _gasLimit, // Minimum L2 gas limit (can be greater than or equal to this value).
    bool _isCreation, // Whether or not the transaction is a contract creation.
    bytes __data // Data to trigger the recipient with.
)
```

** Warning: ** Please do not transfer large amounts of ETH to Layer 2.
It is recommended to transfer a small amount of ETH when bridging for the first time.
Lastly, **DO NOT** transfer WETH or any ERC-20 tokens to the bridge address.
